If you have never worked with GitHub/Git it can be challenging to know where to begin. The purpose of this page is to just simply provide some good references (bookmarks) that can help you get started more quickly....and easily.

## Understanding the process/tools
[How to Github: Fork, Branch, Track, Squash and Pull Request](https://gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request/)

[Contributing to Projects with GitHub Desktop](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/)

## Actually doing it
[Learning Git Branching](http://learngitbranching.js.org/) - Online lab of sorts for trying out and learning Git command line.

## Creating your first pull request
[We created a tutorial](https://github.com/sqlcollaborative/dbatools/wiki/Your-First-Pull-Request) to help you get started. We tried to keep it as brief and easy as possible.

## Really cool tutorial site!
[git-scm](https://git-scm.com/)

**Note:** This entire page is deeply inspired by the work done over in the [dbatool.io](https://github.com/sqlcollaborative/dbatools) module. Pay them a visit and learn from the very same people as we did.
